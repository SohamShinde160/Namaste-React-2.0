## Q: What is the difference between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?

A: ES6 provides us to import & export a module and use it in other files. ES6 provides two ways to export a module from a file: `named export` and `default export`.
In `Named export`, one can have multiple named exports per file. Then import the specific exports they want surrounded in `{}` braces. The name of imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module.
In `Named export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:

```
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
```

and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must use `{}` in MyComponent.

```
// ex. importing a single named export
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

// ex. importing multiple named exports
import { MyComponent, MyComponent2 } from "./MyComponent";

// ex. giving a named import a different name by using "as":
import { MyComponent2 as MyNewComponent } from "./MyComponent";
```

In `Default export`, One can have only one default export per file. The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we like.
In `Default export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:

```
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
```

and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must omit `{}` in MyComponent.

```
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
```

In `* as export`, it is used to import the whole module as a component and access the components inside the module.
In `* as export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:

```
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
export const MyComponent3 = () => {}
```

and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like:

```
import * as MainComponents from "./MyComponent";
```

Now we can use them in JSX as:

```
<MainComponents.MyComponent />
<MainComponents.MyComponent2 />
<MainComponents.MyComponent3 />
```

We can use `Named export` and `Default export` together. So you should export like:

```
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
```

and import like:

```
import MyComponent, {MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";
```

## Q: What are `React Hooks`?

A: In React version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern called Hooks. React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

### React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks:

- useState: To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
- useEffect: To manage side-effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, mutations, and more.
- useContext: To return the current value for a context.
- useReducer: A useState alternative to help with complex state management.
- useCallback: It returns a memorized version of a callback to help a child component not re-render unnecessarily.
- useMemo: It returns a memoized value that helps in performance optimizations.
- useRef: It returns a ref object with a current property. The ref object is mutable. It is mainly used to access a child component imperatively.
- useLayoutEffect: It fires at the end of all DOM mutations. It's best to use useEffect as much as possible over this one as the useLayoutEffect fires synchronously.
- useDebugValue: Helps to display a label in React DevTools for custom hooks.

## Q: Why do we need `useState Hook`?

A: `useState hook` is used to maintain the state in our React application. It keeps track of the state changes so basically useState has the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component.
The useState hook is a special function that takes the `initial state` as an `argument` and `returns an array` of two entries. UseState encapsulate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls.

#### Syntax for useState hook

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate);
```

#### Importing: To use useState you need to import useState from react as shown below:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

we can use Hooks in Functional Components

```
const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}
```
