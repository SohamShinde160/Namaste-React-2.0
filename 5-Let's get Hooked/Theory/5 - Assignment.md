## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini

# Episode 05 - Let's get Hooked!

## Theory:

- What is the `difference` between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?
- What are `React Hooks`?
- Why do we need `useState Hook`?

## Code:

- `Clean up` your code.
- Create a `Folder Structure` for your app.
- Make `different files` for each Component.
- Create a `config file`.
- Use all types of `import and export`.
- Create a `Restaurant Filter button`
- Use `useState` to create a variable and `bind` it to the `Restaurant Filter Button`.
- Try to make your `Filter Button Work`.
